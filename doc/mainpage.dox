 * @mainpage Fortran Neural Network module
 *
 * Welcome to the documentation for the Fortran Neural Network (FNN) module.
 *
 * The main purpose of this module is to provide the class 
 * fnn_network_sequential::sequentialneuralnetwork to be able to handle
 * sequential neural networks within fortran code.
 *
 * The module also provides the python module \ref keras_to_fnn
 * to convert a keras model into a txt file which can be read by FNN.
